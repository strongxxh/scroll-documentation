This guide will walk through how to use Scroll's bridge for ERC20 tokens that need custom functionality by using the Custom Gateway.

<Aside type="tip" title="Do you need custom logic?">
  Remember, for many contexts, you won't need to use the Custom Gateway to add additional features to your token or its bridging logic. See the article on [ETH and ERC20 Token Bridge](/developers/l1-and-l2-bridging/eth-and-erc20-token-bridge#deposit-eth-and-erc20-tokens-from-l1) for more info.

## Step 1: Launch a Token on Sepolia

First, we need a token to bridge. There is no need for a particular ERC20 implementation for a token to be compatible with L2. If you already have a token, feel free to skip the token creation step. If you want to deploy a new token, use the following contract, which creates a simple ERC20 token that mints 1 million tokens to the deployer when launched:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.16;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract L1Token is ERC20 {
  constructor() ERC20("My Token L1", "MTL1") {
    _mint(msg.sender, 1_000_000 ether);
  }
}

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.16;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "@scroll-tech/contracts@0.1.0/libraries/token/IScrollERC20Extension.sol";

contract L2Token is ERC20, IScrollERC20Extension {
  address _gateway;
  address _counterpart;

  constructor(address gateway_, address counterpart_) ERC20("My Token L2", "MTL2") {
    _gateway = gateway_;
    _counterpart = counterpart_;
  }

  function gateway() public view returns (address) {
    return _gateway;
  }

  function counterpart() external view returns (address)
